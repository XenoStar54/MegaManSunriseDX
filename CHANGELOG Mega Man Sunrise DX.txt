This mod seeks to improve certain unpolished elements of the original Mega Man Sunrise and generally smooth over the game without fundamentally changing anything about the identity of the game.
This mostly comes in the form of level design tweaks and edits that make the game more approachable and fair.
Adds a bit of extra content. Some side rooms have been added, some challenges for collectibles changed, etc. The game is now rendered in color instead of monochrome green, much like a Game Boy Color game.
Mod by XenoStar54, original game by DJCoco.

**Currently Known Issues**

- Game has a bad habit of softlocking if left alone too long, but this is a quality of the original that would be nearly impossible for me to fix unless I knew the exact source.

**Content Additions**

- Alternate paths added to every robot master stage, each featuring new uses for existing gimmicks.
- The game is now rendered in color as opposed to monochrome.
- Other specific changes and additions are detailed below.

**Changes**

*Title Screen*

- Game now starts with the grid off by default.

*Stage Select / Other Menus*

- Game saves progress between Wily stages. The player no longer has to complete them all in one go.

*Cutscenes*

- A typo in the intro cutscene was fixed (Dr. Wily replaced with Dr. Light in the line about scrapping Trance).

*Enemy Changes*

- Invincibility frames have been entirely removed from enemies.
- Mets have been modified to allow the player to shoot them as soon as they open. They now also shoot three shots, as in all other Mega Man games.
- Palm Hoppers now shoot slightly less frequently (60 frames -> 70 frames), but the shots themselves are slightly faster (2 -> 2.5 xspeed).
- Batton HP increased from 1 to 2.
- Pipi HP decreased from 2 to 1.
- Armaroid shots are now destructible, as they were in MMV.
- New Shotman AI tweaked to mimic the original, where distance determines which shot the New Shotman will shoot. Before this modification, they always shot their horizontal bullets, even if they were also shooting their vertical bullets, unlike in MM3.
- Hammer Joes now stay vulnerable for slightly longer and throw hammers at a slightly slower (and more reactable) speed.
- Popo Helis now behave as they did in MM9, firing a single burst of flame and then flying directly upwards off of the screen. HP reduced from 3 to 1 as well.
- Sakrets' HP has been lowered from 5 to 3, as in MM9.
- Spines can now be shot to stop their movement for a short time, just like in Mega Man 1.
- Lowered the speed of Screw Bomber projectiles to a more manageable speed.
- Okosutobons now explode after a set period of time, as in MM9.

*Boss Changes*

- Boss invincibility frames decreased very slightly. Should resemble approximately the amount of invincibility frames experienced in other Mega Man games.
- Weakness order is now broken into two chains that are self-contained between the two parts of the game: Vine > Circuit > Valve > Scorch and Kunai > Sound > Haze > Mirage. Secondary weaknesses shuffled slightly.
- Boss contact damage universally lowered slightly.
- Vine Man now moves marginally slower on the ground (1.25 -> 1).
- Valve Man now moves marginally slower on the ground (1.25 -> 1). Valve Man's water balloon attack is also easier to dodge when it splits into three drops.

*Weapon Changes*

- Universally cut lag on all weapon firing. Only certain weapons now have cooldown timers (Vine Whip and Sound Dash).
- Universally changed all non-immune weapons to deal 1 damage to bosses, 2 if a semi-weakness, and 3 if a weakness.
- Mega Buster now does 1 damage instead of 0.5.
- Valve Missile moves slightly faster and costs less weapon energy (2 -> 1).
- Circuit Breaker made slighly faster.
- Kunai Blade made slightly faster and slightly more powerful. 5 should be able to be onscreen at once rather than 3. Ammo consumption upped very slightly (0.1 -> 0.25).
- Mirage Bomb ammo cost lowered marginally (2.5 -> 2).
- Haze Shield ammo cost lowered marginally (3.5 -> 3).
- Trance Wrecker slightly nerfed by increasing its energy cost (1 -> 1.5).

*Miscellaneous Changes*

- The item spawn logic has been altered to match that of Mega Man 2 (1-up: 1/128, Big weapon energy: 5/128, Big health energy: 4/128, Small weapon energy: 25/128, Small health energy: 15/128, Nothing: 78/128). This reduces the amount of items spawned in general, but the game design has been tweaked to be more fair to compensate.

*Vine Man Stage*

- 1-up added in a bonus room near the beginning of the stage.
- First E-Tank room completely redesigned to be remotely interesting.

*Scorch Man Stage*

- Some rooms rearranged a bit. Pointless unbreakable barrier room redone to make more sense.
- M-Tank has been added in a bonus room midway through the stage. The M-Tank in the stage previously is now an E-Tank.

*Circuit Man Stage*

- Ice added to one certain platform near the beginning of the stage that lacked it for some strange reason.
- Weapon energy removed from the sliding E-Tank pickup area, as this immediately softlocks you if you try to fill a weapon up.
- Various Shield Attacker positions have been modified for fairness.

*Valve Man Stage*
- Modified some of the bonus rooms in the stage.
- Several ceilings have been raised to reduce cheap spots in level design.
- Sea mine explosions no longer pass through spikes.
- Climbing down the ladder in the checkpoint room no longer kills the player.

*Kunai Man Stage*

- Added checkpoint where one was originally absent right before the boss room.

*Haze Man Stage*

- Altered several segments to be less player-hostile.

*Wily Stage 1*

- Fixed a graphical issue with a couple of tiles in the room with the Suzies where certain solid-looking tiles have no collision. 
- Removed several cheap spots from the stage.
- Urchin Attacker's vulnerable spot is now easier to hit.

*Wily Stage 3*

- Added a sunrise near the end of the stage for thematic effect.

*Wily Stage 4*

- Made the first final boss cutscene skippable.
